# Go-Phish

This script is designed to help system admins easily scan and remove phishing emails that have been reported in an Office 365 environment. I am also going to build a section within this tool that will function
as a phishing campaign tool. This allow system admins to run their own phishing campaigns without the need for additional licensing or specialized tools.

As of 06/09/2024 I have only completed a few sections. Please see my notes within the script to see what is and isnt working. I am using this project to help me get better at powershell scripting. If you notice
better ways of handling some of this please let me know so I can make changes.
